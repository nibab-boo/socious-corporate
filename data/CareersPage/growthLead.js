          Socious is an impact gig marketplace powered by blockchain and AI.
          <br /><br />
          We started Socious in July 2021 and are supported by 500 Startups and Microsoft for Startups. As an early employee you’ll be pivotal in shaping the direction of the company.
          <br /><br />
          You’ll be able to work fully remotely from anywhere in the world. If you prefer, we can help you secure a
          working visa.
          <br /><br />
          We communicate in English, and so no Japanese ability is required, though there will be opportunities to use Japanese if
          you’d like to.
          <br /><br />
          In this role, you’ll work closely with senior stakeholders to understand business goals and ensure that the growth
          team & tools used are aligned with these. As we grow, you’ll have the opportuntity to move into a Chief Growth Offier role in the future.
