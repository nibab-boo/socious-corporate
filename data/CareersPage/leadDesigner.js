          Socious is an impact gig marketplace powered by blockchain and AI.
          <br /><br />
          We started Socious in July 2021, so as an early employee you’ll be pivotal in shaping the direction of the company. We
          have enough runway to last us through the end of 2022, and are about to close a seed round to allow us to accelerate
          even faster.
          <br /><br />
          You’ll be able to work fully remotely, though we'll meet up in person several times per year, so we're looking for
          someone living in Japan. If you aren't here yet, that's fine: you’ll be able to work remotely until we help you secure a
          working visa.
          <br /><br />
          We communicate in English, and so no Japanese ability is required, though there will be opportunities to use Japanese if
          you’d like to.
          <br /><br />
          We’ve built a prototype version of our app using a combination of part-time freelance developers and offshore
          developers. As we secure funding, we’re now looking to bring on our first full time designer.
          <br /><br />
          In this role, you’ll work closely with senior stakeholders to understand business goals and ensure that the design team & tools used are aligned with these.
          As we grow, you’ll have the opportunity to move into a Chief Design Officer role in the
          future.
