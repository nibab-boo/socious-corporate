        <p>
          Socious is an impact gig marketplace powered by blockchain and AI.
          <br /><br />
          We started Socious in July 2021, so as an early employee you’ll be pivotal in shaping the direction of the company.
          <br /><br />
          You’ll be able to work fully remotely, though we'll meet up in person several times per year, so we're looking for
          someone living in Japan. If you aren't here yet, that's fine: you’ll be able to work remotely until we help you secure a
          working visa.
          <br /><br />
          We communicate in English, and so no Japanese ability is required, though there will be opportunities to use Japanese if
          you’d like to.
          <br /><br />
          You will be working with a team of talented people (three full-time employees + a number of freelancers).
